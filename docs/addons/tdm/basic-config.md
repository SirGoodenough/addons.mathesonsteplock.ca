# Basic Configuration

Use the button below to access the addon configuration page:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of a Supervisor add-on.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=3490a758_tdm)

*If the above link does not work ensure you have completed the [Installation](/docs/installation)*

### Configuration Notes

Either use the WebUI or you can enable the VNC port then use a VNC client like RealVNC viewer to interact with TDM
I highly recommend enabling the watchdog so it will be restarted if it crashes
